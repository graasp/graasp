  # Sign In with email
  
  This endpoint allows to sign into a user account, by providing the email of the account.
  
  The `captcha` key in the body is mandatory in order to verify the request was made from an authorized site.
  
  In development the captcha value is not checked, but it needs to be supplied. Any value will work.

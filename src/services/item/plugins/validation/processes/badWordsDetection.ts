/**
 * TODO: This function code is disabled since there were a lot of false postivives being generated.
 * Legitimate descriptions would get falgged as containing bad words.
 *
 * There are multiple explanations for this:
 * - matching words based on regular expressions and lists does usually not provide a
 *   good user experience (more false positives than actual filtering of legitimate harassement)
 * - no language detection support, so the exhaustive list of swear words in french match agains legitimate content in other langauges
 *   Examples:
 *     - vier (synonym for penis if matched in german, means "four")
 *     - con (sommon insult in french is matched in spanish and italian)

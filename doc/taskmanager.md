# Task runner and database access

The way Graasp accesses the database is by using a system of tasks, that works in the following way:

```typescript
const tm = new TaskManager(dbService);
const ts = tm.createSequence();
const res = await runner.runSequence(ts);
```

The system uses the following components :

- Database services
- Tasks
- Task sequences
- Task managers

## Database services

The database services are the classes where the SQL queries are stored. The database services implement methods to
access the database :

```typescript
export class SomeDBService {
  // The trxHandler is given by the task when executed
  async get<E extends UnknownExtra>(id: string, transactionHandler: TrxHandler): Promise<Item<E>> {
    return transactionHandler
      .query<Item<E>>(
        sql`
        SELECT ${ItemService.allColumns}
        FROM item
        WHERE id = ${id}
        `,
      )
      .then(({ rows }) => rows[0] || null);
  }
}
```

## Tasks

`Tasks` are the smallest unit used to interact with the database. Each task is run in its own transaction.

### Constructors

The constructor usually takes 3 arguments :

- The actor : The id of the member making the request
- One database service : The task should use only one service, if multiple services are needed the task should be split
  into a task sequence
- The input : The user defined parameters that the task needs to successfully execute its query

### Input and getInput()

When a task is created, the developer can give the task an input:

```typescript
new GetItemTask(member, dbservice, input)
```

However, it's possible that the task needs an input coming from another task, to do that the `getInput` method will be
used.
The developer can implement this method in the following manner :

```typescript
t2.getInput = () => {
  return t1.getResult();
};
```

Then, the input from the constructor will be combined with the result of the getInput() when the task is executed.

**Warning! The identical keys from the `input` will be replaced by the values of `getInput()`**

### Skip

This allows to skip the execution of the `Task`, this is especially useful for the task sequences. To skip the task set
the property to true.

```typescript
t1.skip = true;
```

### Result - getResult()

When the task has been successfully executed, the result will be accessible with the `result` property :

```typescript
const result = t1.result;
```

The task can also use the `getResult()` method if the result of the task needs to be different from the result of the
query.

```typescript
// Check if the item exists
const t1 = new GetItemTask();
// Validate the member has read permission
const t2 = new GetMembershipTask();
// returns the item to the user
t2.getResult = () => t1.result;
```

### PreHooks and PostHooks

Every task needs to implement the `name` property, this allows a convenient way to implement pre-hook and post-hook
handlers. These handlers allow plugin to do work on the data before or after an event has happened (e.g. user creation,
item copy, ...).

```typescript
export class SomeTask implements BaseTask<SomeType> {
  // ...
  get name() {
    // return task's name
    return SomeTask.name;
  }
}
```

When a `PreHookHandler` or `PostHookHandler` is registered, the task runner will ensure that all registered handlers are
run. A handler is registered using the name of the task they are attached to.

```typescript
// This is executed before the task makes the query to the database
runner.setTaskPreHookHandler<Item>(taskManager.getCreateTaskName(), async (item) => {
  // code to be run before
});

// this is exectued after the result has been retrieved
runner.setTaskPostHookHandler<Item>(moveItemTaskName, async (item) => {
  // code to be run after
});
```

## Sequences

Sequences are arrays of related tasks that are run in the same transaction. If any task throws an error, the whole
sequence is aborted. The `TaskRunner` will always return the result of the last task in the sequence.

```typescript
// the task runner will always return the result from t3, even if skipped
[t1, t2, t3]
```

A function can create a sequence by using the information already provided and avoid running unnecessary tasks. In the
following example, the `parentItem` is only retrieved if the `parentId` is set.

```typescript
export class TaskManager implements SomeTaskManager<SomeType> {
  // ...
  createSequence(
    member: Actor,
    input: {
      parentId?: string,
      itemId: string
    }
  ) {
    const tasks = [];
    // if parentId is provided, we get the parent too
    if (input.parentId) {
      tasks.push(new GetItemTask(member, dbService, { parentId }));
    }
    tasks.push(new GetItemTask(task));
    return tasks;
  }

  // ...
}
```

If the tasks to execute cannot be determined at creation, the sequence can dynamically skip a task. In the following
example, the second task will be skipped if the `membersId` are not matching, otherwise the task will return the new
input for the execution.

```typescript
export class TaskManager implements SomeTaskManager<SomeType> {
  // ...
  createSequence(
    member: Actor,
    itemMembershipId: string
  ) {
    const t1 = new GetItemMembershipTask(member, this.itemMembershipService, { itemMembershipId });

    const t2 = new GetItemTask(member, this.itemService);
    t2.getInput = () => {
      // if member doesn't have access to the item, no need to get the item
      if (member.id !== t1.result.memberId)
        return { itemPath: t1.result.itemPath };
      t2.skip = true;
    };
  }

  // ...
}
```

## Task Managers

Task managers are the main way to create tasks and task sequences. They implement the methods to create tasks, task
sequences and methods returning the name of the tasks provided.

### Constructors

When a task manager is created, it needs to have all the db services required by all the tasks. By doing so, the task
manager can automatically inject the db services when a new task is created.

```typescript
export class TaskManager implements SomeTaskManager<SomeType> {
  constructor(
    itemService: ItemService,
    itemMembershipService: ItemMembershipService,
    memberService: MemberService,
  ) {
    this.itemService = itemService;
    this.itemMembershipService = itemMembershipService;
    this.memberService = memberService;
  }

  // ...
}
```

### Task names

The method returning the name of the task is used to implement `preHookHandlers` and `postHookHandlers`. The method is
implemented in the following way :

```typescript
export class TaskManager implements SomeTaskManager<SomeType> {
  // ...
  getCreateTaskName(): string {
    return CreateItemTask.name;
  }

  // ...
}
```

### Factory methods

The task manager also implements methods to create new tasks or task sequences. These methods are responsible to inject
the database service when creating a new instance of the task.

```typescript
export class TaskManager implements SomeTaskManager<SomeType> {
  createCreateTask(
    member: Member,
    data: Partial<Item>
  ): CreateItemTask {
    // when the task is created, dbservice is injected
    return new CreateItemTask(member, this.itemService, { data });
  }
}
```

## Task Runner

The task runner executes all the tasks. It has 4 modes of execution.

```typescript
export interface TaskRunner<A extends Actor> {
  // Run given task (transactionally) and return the task's result (or throws error).
  runSingle<T>(task: Task<A, T>, log ?: FastifyLoggerInstance): Promise<T>;

  // Run given tasks (one by one, each in a separate transaction), collect results (values or errors), and return an array with everything.
  runMultiple(tasks: Task<A, unknown> [], log ?: FastifyLoggerInstance): Promise<unknown[]>;

  // Run given task sequence in a single transaction, sequencially, and return the last task's result.
  runSingleSequence(tasks: Task<A, unknown> [], log ?: FastifyLoggerInstance): Promise<unknown>;

  // Run given task sequences (one by one, each in a separate transaction), collect results (values or errors), and return an array with everything.
  runMultipleSequences(tasks: Task<A, unknown> [][], log ?: FastifyLoggerInstance): Promise<unknown>;
}
```

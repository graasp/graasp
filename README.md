## Requirements

In order to run the Graasp backend, it requires:

- Node version 22
- NPM version 10
- Yarn (can be installed through [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/): Docker is not necessary, it is possible to install everything locally. However it is strongly recommended to use the Docker installation guide.

## Recommended Tools

- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [Volta (recommended)](https://volta.sh/) : CLI to manage multiple versions of NodeJs and NPM.
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com) : Application to explore and test your APIs.
- [Starship](https://starship.rs/): A shell prompt enhancer that shows you the current git branch nvm version and package version, very useful for quick look at your environment (works on all shells and is super fast), requires you to use a [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) : IDE to manage the database and make changes to the source code.

  - [Remote-Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) : A extension for VS Code. It allows to easily setup the dev environment.

  - [SQLTools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mtxr.sqltools) : A extension for VS Code. It allows easy access to the database.

## Installation

Graasp offers two ways to install the Graasp backend :

- [Docker](#docker-installation) (recommended) : this allows you to run a preconfigured environment
- [Local](#local-installation) : you'll need to install and configure all the required services

### Docker installation

We recommend to set up the development environment using Docker, as it allows to use a preconfigured development environment.

First open the folder in the dev-container by using the command palette <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (or <kbd>ctrl</kbd> instead of <kbd>cmd</kbd>), and typing `Open Folder in Container`.

This will create 11 containers :

- `core` : Node.js backend of Graasp
- `db` : PostgreSQL cluster used by multiple services
- `etherpad` : Container for the etherpad service
- `meilisearch` : Container for the meilisearch service
- `redis` : Redis instance to enable websockets
- `garage` : An s3-compatible service that works locally
- `localfile` : Simple static file server alternative to s3. Used currently for H5P in local development
- `iframely` : Iframely instance used to get embeds for links
- `mailer` : Simple mailer instance used to receive emails locally (see the [Utilities section](#utilities))
- `umami`: An analytics service used instead of Google Analytics

> **Important**
> To use garage with the Docker installation, it is necessary to edit your `/etc/hosts` with the following line `127.0.0.1 .s3.garage.localhost`. This is necessary because the backend creates signed urls pointing to this subdomain. Without changing the hosts, the development machine cannot resolve urls like `http://s3.garage.localhost:3900` .

> **Troubleshoot**
> If during setup of the devcontainer you get an error like `nudenet Error pull access denied for public.ecr.aws/g...` 
> This can occure if you previously logged in to the public ECR. When you want to pull from the public ECR, you should be unauthenticated. Simply run the following on you host: `docker logout public.ecr.aws`. It will log you out of the public ECR and you should be able to rebuild the containers without issue. If it persissts please [open an issue](https://github.com/graasp/graasp/issues/new?title=NudeNet%20DevContainer%20Docker%20Install%20Issue)

Then install the required npm packages with `yarn install`. You should run this command in the docker's terminal, because some packages are built depending on the operating system (eg. `bcrypt`).

> **Info**
> If the process is killed during the installation of the packages, you'll need to increase the memory limit for docker.  
> To increase the memory limit, go to `Docker > Preferences > Resources` and change the memory from default (2 GB) to 8GB.

Once the packages are installed we need to bootstrap the database. Run this line in the terminal of the DevContainer. It will connect to the Postgres Engine running in the `db` container with the `docker` user and run the `bootstrapDB.sql` file. You will be asked for a password. Enter `docker`.

```sh
psql -h db -U docker -f bootstrapDB.sql
```

It will create 4 roles with their associated database for the services that need them:

- Graasp: the db for the backend
- Umami: google analytics replacement
- Etherpad: real-time documents
- Test: a test database that will be wiped during tests

### Local Installation

First a running and accessible instance of PostgreSQL is required.

To enable websockets capabilities, it is required to have a running instance of [Redis](https://redis.io).

To use the backend with S3, it is required to have a running instance of [garage](https://git.deuxfleurs.fr/Deuxfleurs/garage).

Then open the folder locally and run the following command to install the required npm packages.

```sh
yarn install
```

## Configuration

To configure the application, you'll need to change the values in `.env.development`. The file should have the following structure :

> We provide sample values for development purposes aligned with the devcontainer configuration. Adjust these values as needed.

```bash
### Graasp back-end configuration

### Network configuration

# Default protocol is already set

GEOLOCATION_API_KEY=
```

### Garage

You will need to configure the garage instance so you can use the s3 buckets with the proper access keys.

To simplify the commands you can create an alias to the docker exec command:

Run this on the host machine
```sh
# get the container name for the garage service
docker ps

# complete the command with the container name of the garage service (something like `core_devcontainer-garage-1`)
alias garage="docker exec -it <container-name> /garage"
```

You should now be able to run commands against the garage executable running inside the container. Check that it works by running: 

```sh
garage status
```

You should see an output similar to: 

```
2025-09-11T05:42:45.393828Z  INFO garage_net::netapp: Connected to 127.0.0.1:3901, negotiating handshake...    
2025-09-11T05:42:45.436392Z  INFO garage_net::netapp: Connection established to fca7df6b0fe8115c    
==== HEALTHY NODES ====
ID                Hostname    Address         Tags  Zone  Capacity   DataAvail         Version
fca7df6b0fe8115c  garage  127.0.0.1:3901  []    dc1   1000.0 MB  365.8 GB (36.8%)  v2.0.0
```

#### Config

Now for the real configuration part.

We will:
- setup the layout for the storage (this is required by garage to know how it allocates the capacity)
- create the file-items bucket (h5p bucket can be configured too, guide does not do it currently)
- create an access key for the bucket
- make the correct configurations to be able to access the bucket

Layout setup
```sh
# get the node id
garage status

# -z defines the zone for the node, -c defines the capacity, in single node this has no impact
garage layout assign -z dc1 -c 1G <node-id>

# apply the layout
garage layout apply --version 1
```

Create a bucket
```sh
garage bucket create file-items

garage bucket list

garage bucket info file-items
```

Create an access key. Make not of the secret key as it will not be shown again !
```sh
garage key create core-s3-key

# allow the key to access the bucket
garage bucket allow --read --write --owner file-items --key core-s3-key
```




### Umami

To log into umami in your local instance: [Umami login documentation](https://umami.is/docs/login)

The first time you log in use username: `admin` and password: `umami`. It is recommended to change these.

## Running

To run the application, use `yarn watch`. If any file change, the application will automatically reload.

You can also run `yarn seed` to feed the database with predefined mock data.

## Utilities

The development [docker-compose.yml](.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml) provides an instance of [mailcatcher](https://mailcatcher.me/), which emulates a SMTP server for sending e-mails. When using the email authentication flow, the mailbox web UI is accessible at [http://localhost:1080](http://localhost:1080).

The development [docker-compose.yml](.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml) provides a [s3-compatible service](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/) for serving files. Ensure you have setup your /etc/hosts so that it works. 

## Testing

To run the tests locally without obliterating your database you should create a new `.env.test` file that can contain the same values as your `.env.development` file.
Simply change the config values for the database connection:

```sh
DB_CONNECTION=postgres://test:test@db:5432/test?sslmode=disable
```

This will ensure your tests run on the second database container. As they will create new data and sometimes delete data between test runs you will not loose your development data.

## Database and Migrations

The application will run migrations on start.

### Create a migration

Migrations are saved in `src/migrations/*.ts`. They are then transformed into js files so typeorm can run them.

Run the generate and run command to create and apply the migration.

```sh
yarn migration:generate
yarn migration:run
```

If you need to revert

```sh
yarn migration:revert
```

To test your migrations, you can run

```sh
yarn migration:fake
```

Each migration should have its own test to verify the `up` and `down` procedures in `test/migrations`.

Up tests start from the previous migration state, insert mock data and apply the up procedure. Then each table should still contain the inserted data with necessary changes. The down tests have a similar approach.

## Troubleshooting

### Nudenet Container can not be pulled

It is possible that the nudenet container pull fails with a 403 status code. This is likely because you are authenticated to the public AWS ECR and trying to pull a public image. Log out of the public ECR with `docker logout public.ecr.aws` and try building the devContainer again. 

### Uploading files results in "AuthorizationHeaderMalformed: Authorization header malformed, unexpected scope"

This upload error occurs when we try to upload a file to s3 (mocked by garage on local dev setup).

You need to check that you:
- have access and secret keys in your env
- have set the region to the same value as the ".devcontainer/garage/garage.toml" file (look under the `s3.api` section for the `s3_region` value.) By default it should be `garage` and not `us-east-1`. Update the value in your `.env.development` file.

### Uploading files throws with "Invalid signature"

This error indicated that the keys to access the buckets are not correct, ensure that you have copied the full key (beware line breaks) and that they are available from the process env.

## Openapi

Generate an `openapi.json` specification file by running the following query. You should have built the backend at least once beforehand.

```sh
yarn openapi:generate
```

You can then lint the specifications with

```sh
yarn openapi:lint
```
